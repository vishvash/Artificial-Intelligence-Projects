Mean, Median, and Mode are the three measures that are used for calculating the Central Tendency. The average of all the data points in a data is called as mean. Median is the middle-most value of all the data points after sorting. The mode is known to be the most frequently occurring value, commonly used for working on categorical data. The biggest disadvantage is that the mean gets influenced by the outliers (also known as extreme values).Dispersion is the term used for the spread of data. The measured used for the analysis of Dispersion of data are Variance, Standard Deviation, and Range. Variance can be explained as the measure of the spread of the data from the centre. It is calculated as the average squared values of the distance of each data point from the mean of the data. Variance calculates the spread of the data from the mean, but for the calculation distance, square values are considered, hence the units get squared. To bring the units back to the original level we apply square root on top of variance, this value is known as Standard Deviation. In Variance, we calculate the square for distance, but along with the distance, the unit also gets squared, so to get back units we use standard deviation. Maximum \u2013 Minimum is the range for any given data. It represents the limits of the spread for the data. Range = (Max \u2013 Min)Skewness talks about the symmetry, concentration of data being more at one place than the other. The asymmetric distribution of the data points in data is known as Skewness. The data is said to be highly skewed, when it is between > +1 & < -1, moderately skewed, when it is between 0.5 & +1 / -0.5 & -1, and approximately symmetric when it is between 0.5 & -0.5.Kurtosis defines the peakedness of the distribution in the dataset. For Symmetric distributions, if the curve has a wider peak and thinner tails, it implies negative Kurtosis. For Symmetric distributions, if the curve has a narrow peak and wider tails, it indicates positive Kurtosis. If k=3, it follows a normal distribution\nIf k>3, it is called Leptokurtic distribution\nIts central peak higher and sharper and its tails are longer and fatter. If K<3, it is called Platykurtic distribution\nThe central peak is wide compared to a normal distribution and lowers as well, and the tails are shorter and thinner.","qas":[{"question":"what is central tendency?","id":"fde811f6-5b23-497a-988e-6a6e56a8e35d","answers":[{"answer_start":0,"text":"\ufeffThe Mass/Concentration of the data is termed as the Central Tendency"}]},{"question":"define central tendency?","id":"95bab72e-bff6-44d3-962d-8172f15e79a3","answers":[{"answer_start":1,"text":"The Mass/Concentration of the data is termed as the Central Tendency."}]},{"question":"what are the measures of central tendency?","id":"67f39e06-4b36-437e-b54d-8436d25a2f91","answers":[{"answer_start":71,"text":"Mean, Median, and Mode are the three measures that are used for calculating the Central Tendency."}]},{"question":"what do you mean by central tendency?","id":"1864a56e-aa76-4b1a-b90b-579d4b9439c6","answers":[{"answer_start":1,"text":"The Mass/Concentration of the data is termed as the Central Tendency."}]},{"question":"explain the measures of central tendency?","id":"4987693a-e853-4020-a845-57a8c262a2c1","answers":[{"answer_start":71,"text":"Mean, Median, and Mode are the three measures that are used for calculating the Central Tendency.

Data Science is a subset of AI which focuses majorly on data, which involves developing methods to store and analyze the data to effectively extract meaning insights. Machine learning is a subset of data science which focuses mostly on building models by using the data.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which is used to build AI systems, it teaches the computer to do human activities that come naturally. Entropy is a measure of randomness in the information which is being processed. If the entropy is high then it will be very difficult to conclude from the information. For example, flipping a coin can provide random information. A flipped coin can have any outcome for \u2018n\u2019 number of tosses which is very difficult to predict the outcome. This is what exactly is the Entropy. K means clustering is used for solving Unsupervised learning problems where there is no Y. It divides the data into some clusters such that the cluster which is formed is homogeneous in nature, also the points in each cluster are very close to each other. K nearest neighbours are used to solve Supervised learning problems. It classifies the unlabelled data point using its neighbouring data points. The number here can be anything and it represents the number of neighbours that it has to consider while labelling the unlabelled data point. As the training time related to it is very less hence it is called the lazy learner. K-Fold cross-validation is a technique that is normally used in supervised learning. It is used when the dataset is small. Training the model on small datasets might end overfitting the model and may also fall into an imbalance dataset category.","qas":[{"question":"what is covariate shift?","id":"eed2d1ad-95c9-4895-97ae-d52c7cef9bda","answers":[{"answer_start":0,"text":"In the case of deep networks, the input to each layer is affected by parameters in all the input layers.
